/* This is an implementation of PCSA algorithm as described in the paper
 * "Probalistic Counting Algorithms for Data Base Applications", published
 * by Flajolet and Martin in 1985. Generally it is an advanced version of
 * the 'probabilistic.c' algorithm.
 *
 * There is a small change of the implementation - the original algorithm
 * divides the hash value into two parts (hash MOD m) and (hash DIV m), but
 * we do it a bit differently - we use the first 2 bytes (16 bits) to compute
 * the bitmap index, and the remaining bytes.
 *
 * FIXME The bitmaps are too big (about 15B each, which is way too much as
 * the length in bits determines the possible number of distict values to be
 * tracked - 4B = 32b makes it possible to track up to 2^32 distinct values).
 * So the bitmaps might be much smaller in reality.
